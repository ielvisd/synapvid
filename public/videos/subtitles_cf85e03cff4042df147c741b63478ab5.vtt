1.1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Welcome! Today, we explore Newton's First Law of Motion.

1.2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.000
We'll use a hockey puck to understand the concept of inertia.

2.1
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Newton's First Law states that an object at rest stays at rest.

2.2
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a net force.

2.3
00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This behavior is called inertia.

3.1
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let’s see how a force affects the hockey puck.

3.2
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:30.000
When I hit the puck, it moves forward, demonstrating the change in motion.

3.3
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This shows how inertia works in real life.

4.1
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.500
In summary, inertia keeps objects in their state of motion.

4.2
00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.000
Understanding this principle helps us analyze movement in sports and beyond.
